    <p>A necklace for women has always been an integral part of Indian jewellery, whether it’s for a bride’s big day or her daily styling ritual. Make every moment special by adding antiques, 92.5 silver temples, zircons, and more to your festive looks.

<br>The tradition of the necklace dates back to the Harappan Civilisation, where metal ornaments and pendants were worn as a symbol of beauty and culture. Today, we find these heritage pieces recreated in intricate necklace designs, featuring divine motifs, auspicious detailing, and timeless craftsmanship.

If you are looking for the perfect set,<br><br> Kushal’s offers a wide curation—pearl accents, butterfly motifs, pink stone highlights, and antique-inspired pieces. From daily elegance to heavy festive wear, you’ll find it all. Explore our collection, along with versatile favourites like the Choker Necklace, Silver Necklace, and Antique Necklace, and choose what resonates with your style.

Antique Necklaces
If you’re after heritage charm, antique necklace designs are a must-have. These pieces feature intricate detailing and vintage artistry that modern techniques cannot replicate. Perfect for weddings or festive gatherings, antique necklaces for women bring old-world beauty into contemporary fashion.

Kundan Necklaces
Kundan jewellery has long been treasured for its regal look. A Kundan necklace with semi-precious stones offers elegance for both brides and guests. These statement pieces are equally cherished as gifts, adding grandeur to every jewellery box.</p>
